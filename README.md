Supply Chain Forecasting & Optimization 📦

Project Overview

This project applies advanced forecasting and optimization techniques to a supply chain dataset. Using time series analysis and machine learning models, the analysis aims to enhance demand prediction, optimize fulfillment center operations, and improve decision-making in supply chain logistics.

Problem Statement

A meal delivery service company needs to optimize its supply chain network by accurately forecasting demand across multiple fulfillment centers. The challenge involves improving inventory management, reducing waste, and ensuring timely deliveries while accounting for seasonality, promotions, and external demand factors.

🔑 Key Objectives

Analyze historical demand patterns for meal products

Identify seasonality and trends in sales data

Develop time series forecasting models to predict future demand

Evaluate machine learning approaches for demand prediction

Assess model performance and optimize forecasting strategies

📊 Data Analysis Components

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning

Merging multiple datasets (fulfillment centers, meal information, training/test sets)

Handling missing values and outliers

Mapping weekly sales data to calendar dates

2. Time Series Visualization

Trend and seasonality detection

Promotional impact analysis

Stationarity testing (ADF test, autocorrelation analysis)

3. Forecasting Models

Statistical Methods:

ARIMA, SARIMA for classical time series forecasting

Machine Learning Models:

XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for demand prediction

Feature engineering to incorporate promotions, seasonal effects, and regional factors

Model Evaluation:

RMSE, MAPE, and R-Squared for performance assessment

🛠️ Technical Stack

Python: Primary programming language

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis

Statsmodels, pmdarima: Time series forecasting

Scikit-learn, XGBoost: Machine learning models

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

📈 Key Findings

Sales trends exhibit strong promotional effects rather than pure seasonality

ARIMA struggles with demand fluctuations, while machine learning models capture nonlinear dependencies better

Forecasting accuracy improves significantly with feature-rich ML models

Promotions and external factors play a crucial role in demand forecasting
