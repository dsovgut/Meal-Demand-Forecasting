# Advanced Supply Chain Forecasting & Optimization üì¶

## Project Overview
This research initiative employs sophisticated forecasting and optimization methodologies to enhance supply chain decision-making. By integrating time series analytics and machine learning paradigms, the study aims to refine demand prediction, streamline fulfillment center operations, and fortify logistical efficiencies.

## Problem Statement
A meal delivery enterprise seeks to optimize its supply chain network by refining demand forecasting across multiple fulfillment centers. The primary challenges encompass inventory management optimization, waste minimization, and the assurance of timely deliveries while accounting for seasonality, promotional interventions, and exogenous demand fluctuations.

## üîë Key Objectives
- Conduct a rigorous analysis of historical demand fluctuations for meal products
- Identify underlying seasonality and sales trends through empirical evaluation
- Construct robust time series forecasting models to enhance predictive capabilities
- Benchmark machine learning methodologies for demand estimation
- Rigorously assess model performance and optimize forecasting methodologies
